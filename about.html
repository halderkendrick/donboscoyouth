        <div class="about-text">
            <p><strong>Don Bosco</strong>, also known as <em>Saint John Bosco</em>, was born on August 16, 1815, in Italy. He lost his father at a young age and was raised by his mother, Margherita. From childhood, he had a deep love for God and a desire to help others.</p>

            <p>After becoming a priest in 1841, he saw the suffering of poor and homeless boys in the streets of Turin. To help them, he started the <strong>Oratory of Don Bosco</strong>, a place where boys could pray, study, and learn skills. He believed in the <em>Preventive System</em> of education, which focused on reason, religion, and loving-kindness rather than punishment.</p>

            <p>In 1859, he founded the <strong>Salesian Society</strong> to continue his mission of educating and caring for youth. With Saint Maria Mazzarello, he also founded the Salesian Sisters for girls. Don Bosco worked tirelessly for young people until his death on January 31, 1888.</p>

            <p>He was declared a saint in 1934. Today, the Salesians work in over 130 countries, continuing his mission to help the poor and educate the young. Don Bosco is remembered as the <strong>“Father and Teacher of Youth”</strong> and a true friend to children in need.</p>

            <h3>Don Bosco Youth Club</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Don Bosco Youth Club</strong> or <strong>Don Bosco Jubo Songho</strong>, situated in Moushair, Dhaka, Bangladesh, is a dynamic youth organization operating under the guidance of the Salesians of Don Bosco—a Roman Catholic religious institute dedicated to the holistic development of young people. Established in 2018, the organization has become a cornerstone for youth engagement in the region.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Salesians of Don Bosco initiated their mission in Bangladesh in 2009, focusing on establishing educational centers in remote areas where quality education is scarce. In Moushair, a temporary chapel was inaugurated in 2018, and by 2022, Don Bosco School Dhaka and St. John Bosco Church were established, leading to the formation of <strong>St. John Bosco Parish</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don Bosco Youth Club actively engages the local youth through a variety of programs, including sports competitions, cultural events, and religious activities. Notably, the organization celebrated a significant achievement by becoming the champion at the <strong>Under-16 School Basketball Tournament 2025</strong> organized by the Bangladesh Basketball Federation. 
                Additionally, the youth participate in cultural performances, such as dance events, showcasing their talents and fostering community spirit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Through these initiatives, Don Bosco Youth Club continues to inspire and support the youth community, contributing positively to their personal growth and the broader society.
