            <h3>St. John Bosco: The Father of Youth</h3>

            St. John Bosco, also known as Don Bosco, was an Italian priest, educator, and writer who dedicated his life to the betterment of poor and abandoned youth. Born on August 16, 1815, in the small village of Becchi, Italy, Bosco grew up in a time of great social and economic hardship. Despite these difficulties, he developed a deep love for God and a passion for helping young people, which led him to establish the Salesian Society, an organization dedicated to education and charity. His work revolutionized the way society approached youth development and continues to influence educational methods today.
            
            <h3>Early Life and Calling</h3>
            
            John Bosco lost his father at the age of two, leaving his mother, Margaret, to raise him and his siblings in poverty. Despite financial struggles, Margaret instilled strong Christian values in her children. At a young age, John felt a calling to the priesthood and worked tirelessly to support his education, often taking on various jobs to pay for schooling. His determination and faith led him to the seminary, and he was ordained a priest in 1841.
            
            <h3>Mission to Help Youth</h3>
            
            Upon becoming a priest, Don Bosco encountered many poor and neglected boys in Turin, Italy. Seeing their dire circumstances, he began offering them education, shelter, and moral guidance. He believed that kindness, rather than punishment, was the best way to shape young minds. His approach, known as the "Preventive System," focused on reason, religion, and loving kindness, ensuring that children felt valued and respected.
            
            <h3>Founding of the Salesian Society</h3>
            
            Realizing the growing need for organized support, Don Bosco founded the Salesian Society in 1859, named after St. Francis de Sales. The society provided education and vocational training to young boys, preparing them for a brighter future. Later, along with St. Mary Mazzarello, he established the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, a similar institution for girls.
            
            <h3>Legacy and Canonization</h3>
            
            Don Bosco’s impact extended beyond Italy, with Salesian schools, colleges, and orphanages spreading worldwide. He wrote numerous books and religious texts to educate young people and their mentors. His unwavering dedication to youth earned him great respect, and in 1934, Pope Pius XI canonized him as a saint.
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            St. John Bosco remains a symbol of selfless service and education. His innovative approach to youth development, emphasizing love and kindness, continues to inspire educators and caregivers globally. His legacy lives on through the Salesian institutions that provide hope and opportunities to thousands of children, keeping his mission alive. Through his faith, compassion, and dedication, St. John Bosco truly became the "Father of Youth."
